API
- Basically is like rails that I'm writing now, the difference is that the API is open to public
Hence, it can't redirect here and there like what I did here
So in normal API, they only show in json format to show that whether the action did in the API was success or fail

Something like this will render in a real API
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      render json: {
        success: true,
        user: @user
      }, status: 200
    else
      render json: {
        success: false,
        message: @user.errors.full_messages
      }, status: 500
    end
  end
